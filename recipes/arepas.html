            These arepas have a crispy crust while the cheese inside stays melty and gives you 
            that cheese-pull that everyone knows and loves.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)/li>
            <li>2 ½ cups warm water</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup canola oil, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shred 3 ounces of the mozzarella and cut remaining 5 ounces into 
                1/2-inch cubes. Transfer shredded cheese to a large bowl and cubed cheese 
                to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, and warm water to the shredded cheese and 
                mix to combine. Set aside for 10 minutes to allow cornmeal to absorb liquid. 
                The mixture should resemble soft Play-Doh.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
            <li>With damp palms and fingers, place 1/4 cup arepa mixture into your palm 
                and flatten into a 2 1/2-inch disk. Place 3 to 4 cubes of the mozzarella 
                into the center. Gently fold edges of dough over to cover mozzarella cubes 
                completely, patting to form a cake. Repeat until all dough and 
                cheese has been used.</li>
        </ol>
